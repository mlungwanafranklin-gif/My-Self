                <p> 15 May 2004, Johannesburg South Africa, a legend is born. Hey there my name is Franklin Mlungwana a
                    son, friend, brother, and lover to music.</p>

                <p>I had a humble yet joyful upbringing, surrounded by love, faith, and strong family values. Growing up
                    as the second of four children meant learning early on how to balance being a role model and a
                    friend. My parents and siblings taught me the importance of kindness, hard work, and staying
                    grounded no matter where life takes you.</p>
                <p>Life in Jo’burg kept me curious and resilient — a place where every challenge became a lesson and
                    every moment with family shaped me into who I am today.</p>

            <h2 style="color: black; text-align: center;"><b>Life in motion</b></h2>
            <p>Life, to me, is a journey of constant motion — full of lessons, growth, and new experiences that shape
                who we become.
                Every step I’ve taken has taught me something valuable: patience through challenges, gratitude in small
                victories, and
                faith when the path ahead wasn’t clear.

                I’ve learned that progress isn’t always about moving fast, but about moving with purpose. Whether it’s
                in my studies, my
                spiritual journey, or my personal goals, I try to keep pushing forward, learning as I go, and embracing
                every
                opportunity to grow. Life doesn’t stand still, and neither should we.

                “Life in motion” means choosing to evolve — to keep improving, forgiving, loving, and striving to become
                better than
                yesterday. It’s about building habits that reflect who I want to be, surrounding myself with people who
                uplift me, and
                remembering that even small steps count when you’re walking in the right direction.

                Each day adds another scene to my story, and I want mine to be filled with faith, hard work, learning,
                and service.
                Because at the end of the day, life isn’t just about where you’re going — it’s about who you become
                along the way.</p>

            <h3 style="color: black; text-align: center;"><b>Faith and hustle</b></h3>
            <p>Passion and determination are at the core of who I am. Whether it’s pursuing my dreams or supporting
                those I care about, I believe in giving my all. My heart drives me to connect with others and make a
                positive impact, while my hustle keeps me focused on achieving my goals. I'm a spiritual person so every
                day is a opportunity to find a way to be of service to my fellow men. As my favorite verse in the Book
                Of Mormon says <strong><i>"And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may
                        learn that
                        when ye are in the service of your
                        fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."</i></strong></p>

            <p>I’m not afraid to take risks or face challenges head-on, because I know that with hard
                work and dedication, anything is possible.My values come from my family and my faith, reminding me that
                real success isn’t just about what you achieve, but how you treat others along the way. I’m motivated by
                progress — not perfection — and every day I try to grow in small, meaningful ways. I’m eager to venture
                into the <strong>IT</strong> space, exploring fields like web development, programming, and technology
                innovation.Technology has always fascinated me — the way it connects people, transforms ideas into
                reality, and drives progress across the world. I want to be part of that movement. My vision is to grow
                into someone who not only understands technology but uses it to make a real difference in people’s
                lives.</p>

            <p>
                The journey ahead excites me. I'm ready to venture into new opportunities, explore my potential,
                and keep growing in every part of my life. I see the future as a chance to build something meaningful —
                <i>spiritually, personally, and professionally</i>. One of my greatest dreams is to one day get married
                and
                build a loving, faith-centered family of <i>my own</i>. I also want to keep learning — not for financial
                gain,
                but for the joy of gaining wisdom and understanding that help me become a better person. The road ahead
                may be uncertain, but I'm walking it with hope, courage, and complete trust in God's timing.
